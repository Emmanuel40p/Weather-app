*Here is the challenge*

You're creating a simple weather app that displays a message based on the temperature. Can you write a JavaScript code that takes the temperature as input and displays:

- "It's hot!" if the temperature is above 25째C.
- "It's cold!" if the temperature is below 15째C.
- "It's just right!" if the temperature is between 15째C and 25째C.

cold color: rgba(3, 85, 255, 0.99) 

hot Color:rgba(171, 38, 21, 0.99) ;

warm color.rgba(80, 255, 202);
